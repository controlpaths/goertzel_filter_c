# GenesysZU repository by controlpaths.

## Board file
Board file for Genesys ZU can be found at Digilent's repository. (https://github.com/Digilent/vivado-boards/tree/master/new/board_files).

## Automatic project creation.
Each project has a script associated to him. For create the project, init Vivado in tcl mode, and the execute the selected script.

```
cd scrips/
vivado -mode tcl -source ./<tcl_name>.tcl
```
## Hardware configuration
Projects in this repository are designed to run in Genesys ZU board from Digilent,

## Python Script
This repository include a python script for generate .mem files. Files generated by script are saved in */memory_content* directory.

**zu_goertzel_rtu.tcl**  
This project uses the PL to implement a driver for the ZMOD ADC at 100MHz. In the PS, RTU execute a goertzel algorithm to detect a 30Mhz harmonic.  

**z7_fsk_modulation.tcl**
This script generate a project for Eclypse Z7 board for generate a design that generate a fsk modulation with 3 different frequencies, one base of 3MHz, on mid frequency of 15MHz and one high of 30MHz.
